## Description
As a developer, I want a README generator, so that I can quickly create README for any of my new projects.


## Installation
This readme generator will provide the file for your project, execute using the terminal.


## Usage
Once executed using the command "node index.js" filename.md (filename is something that is decided by the user at the time of execution).

## Instructions
1. Locate index.js File: Navigate to the index.js file in your project directory. (VS-Code and files required for running on your local machine)

2. Open Integrated Terminal: Right-click on the index.js file and select the option to open it in an integrated terminal. This action will open a terminal window within your code editor.

3. Run Generator: In the terminal, input the command: **node index.js NewReadMe.md**

    ![Alt - type this on the terminal line](./assets/images/filename%20to%20input.jpg)

4. Press Enter to proceed. (The filename is specified at the beginning of the process)

5. Answer Prompts: Respond to the prompts and provide the necessary information as prompted.

6. Generate README: Upon completing the prompts, the generator will process your inputs and generate a README file named according to your specification (e.g., NewReadMe.md) in the same directory as index.js.

7. Review and Edit: Take a moment to review the generated README file to ensure accuracy and organization. Make any required edits or additions.

8. Save Changes: Save the README file along with any modifications you've made.

9. Customize Filename: Replace "NewReadMe.md" with your preferred filename for the README file and relocate it to the appropriate location within your project.

    *Congratulations! You've successfully utilized the README generator to create a comprehensive README file for your project.*

## Challenges

1. Multiple ways of executing this, figured out the best way that works with most projects

2. Resolved getting the license badge to show up appropriately after user selected license

3. Fixed the naming, file cleanup, the readme template final update prior to release

## Test
Testing with instructor and TAs along with consistent testing throughout each iteration prior to submission.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] As per the specifications, this application is not intended for deployment. Instead, we have **provided a walkthrough video** showcasing its functionality, accessible via the following link: [Readme Generator - User Flow/Walkthrough Video Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VILGl0B3a1122gd4VPx4CITtOe0BDlZV/view)

- [x] Command line application that accepts user input when prompted about application repository: passed testing with two TAs

- [x] High quality **README.md** is generated with the title of the project and sections included at the minimum are Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions filled in with the information the user provided via previous prompts

- [x] Title of project is the title of the readme

- [x] Choose a license from a list of options, **badge** for that license is presented at the top of the readme file, and under license it explains which license the application is covered under
